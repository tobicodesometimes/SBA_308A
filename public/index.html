    <h1>Naruto Character Explorer</h1>
    <p><strong>Synopsis: </strong>Twelve years before the start of the series, the ninja village of Konohagakure was
        attacked by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. The village was only saved from complete destruction by the actions of
        Konoha's leader, the Fourth Hokage, who sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn: Naruto
        Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto grew up shunned by most of the villagers, who hated and feared him
        because of the Nine-Tails trapped within him. Unaware of the monster he contained, Naruto longed for
        acknowledgment, and so vowed to one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.</p>

    <p><strong>Naruto</strong>, created by Masashi Kishimoto, follows Naruto Uzumaki — an orphaned ninja who dreams of
        becoming Hokage (Head of the Village) —in a world of hidden villages, chakra, and bloodline techniques; the
        manga ran from 1999 ~ 2014 and the anime aired from 2002 ~ 2017 (Naruto + Shippūden); its sequel <em>Boruto:
            Naruto Next Generations</em> continues with the next generation and branches into its own storyline.</p>
